# Token Enrollment

This document explains the **token enrollment process** implemented in this privacyIDEA deployment.

---

## 🎯 Supported Token Types

- HOTP (HMAC-based One-Time Password)
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)

These tokens provide MFA for user authentication.

---

## 🧩 Enrollment Flow

1. User authenticates with username + password
2. Token enrollment is initiated via WebUI or self-service
3. QR code is generated
4. User scans QR code with an authenticator app
5. Token is assigned to the user
6. Optional PIN is set

---

## 📱 QR Code Enrollment

- QR codes are generated by privacyIDEA
- Compatible with:
  - Google Authenticator
  - Microsoft Authenticator
  - FreeOTP
  - Authy

---

## 🔑 Authentication Model

Authentication requires:

- Something the user **knows** (PIN)
- Something the user **has** (OTP token)

This ensures strong two-factor authentication.

---

## 📜 Policy Control

Token enrollment and usage are controlled via policies:

- Who can enroll tokens
- Which token types are allowed
- Whether PIN is required

(See `docs/policies.md`)

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Tokens are bound to users
- Token secrets are stored encrypted
- Enrollment can be restricted to specific realms

---

## ✅ Result

The system enforces **strong MFA** using industry-standard OTP tokens with controlled enrollment.
